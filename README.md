A program to ask for the user's name, then say `Hello $name` in as many languages as I could get running on the Raspberry Pi, plus instructions on how I got the language onto the Pi where required.

The instructions for each language can be found in the folder for that language

Hope it's helpful for someone.

### Usage:

Go to a folder you want this repoository copied to, and type:

    git clone https://github.com/timyates/RaspberryGreet.git
    cd RaspberryGreet
